DoxyTools is an extension for Visual Studio 2022 designed to streamline the process of generating and viewing documentation directly within the IDE.
## Doxygen vs. DoxyTools
### Doxygen
- **Doxygen** is an external tool used to generate HTML documentation for C/C++ code. This documentation provides a website-like interface for exploring the codebase, including relationships, definitions, and other details.
### DoxyTools
- **DoxyTools** is a Visual Studio extension that facilitates the use of Doxygen within the IDE. Key benefits include:
    - Quickly run Doxygen on specific projects or the entire solution without navigating outside of Visual Studio or having to worry about where to store the documentation in `Client`.
    - Conveniently view existing Doxygen-generated documentation for projects, as the extension knows where the output is stored in `Client`.

## Installation
To install Doxygen:
1. Search "Doxygen" in your favorite browser (the official website of Doxygen (as of 1/2/2024) is www.doxygen.nl).
2. Find the download link on the official website and download the version for your specific machine.
To install DoxyTools in Visual Studio:
1. Navigate to `Client\Documentation_Tools\DoxyTools`.
2. Double-click on the `DoxyTools.vsix` file to initiate installation.
3. Close any open instances of Visual Studio to allow the installation to complete.

## Understanding Documentation Output
For clarity, the term "Doc" refers to the HTML output generated by running Doxygen on a directory, project, or solution.
- **Project-level Generation**: Creates a single Doc for the selected project.
- **Solution-level Generation**: Produces one comprehensive Doc for the entire solution.
- **All Projects Generation**: Generates separate Docs for each project within the solution.

## Generating Documentation
### Project Level
Right-click a project in the Solution Explorer to access DoxyTools commands:
- **Generate Doxygen Docs For This Project**: Starts Doxygen for the project's directory (based on the project's `.vcxproj` file location). Settings are determined by the `Doxyfile` in this directory. Output is stored in `Client\_Documentation\[PROJECT_NAME]`.
- **View Current Docs For This Project**: Opens the `index.html` file from the project's documentation in `Client\_Documentation\[PROJECT_NAME]`.
### Solution Level
Right-click the solution in the Solution Explorer:
- **Generate Doxygen Docs for Solution**: Generates documentation for the entire solution, outputting a single comprehensive Doc in `Client\_Documentation\Client`.
### All Projects
In the Visual Studio toolbar (at the top of the window):
- Navigate to the **Extensions** menu.
- Select **Generate Doxygen Docs For All Projects** to generate individual Docs for each project sequentially.

## Cancelling Documentation Generation
To cancel an ongoing documentation generation process:
- Go to the **Extensions** menu in the Visual Studio toolbar.
- Click on **Cancel Doc Generation**. This stops any running Doxygen process initiated by DoxyTools.

## Requirements for Using DoxyTools
- **Doxygen**: Ensure you have Doxygen installed on your machine.
- **Client Instance**: A version of the `Client` must be present on your machine.
- **Doxyfile Presence**: Each submodule to be documented should have a `Doxyfile`. Use `Client\Documentation_Tools\DoxyTools\Quick_Scripts\Add-Doxyfiles-to-Client.py` to automatically create `Doxyfile`s.
- **Documentation Folders**: The `Client\_Documentation` directory should contain a folder for each project. Use `Client\Documentation_Tools\DoxyTools\Quick_Scripts\Add-Doc-Folders.py` to set up these folders.

## Overview of Documentation Structure in Client
- Source code and installation file (`DoxyTools.vsix`) are located in `Client\Documentation_Tools`.
- Project documentation is stored in `Client\_Documentation`, with each project (and `Client`) having its own folder.
